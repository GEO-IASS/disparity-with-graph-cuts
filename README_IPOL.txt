This software is an extract of a more complete software provided by V. Kolmogorov (called "match"). It has been cleaned in order to keep only functions needed to use the algorithm "kz2" presented in the IPOL article intitled "Computing Visual Correspondence with Occlusions using Graph Cuts".

Please follow Kolmogorov's instructions to install and use this software.

The source code contains two kinds of comments: the ones from the author Kolmogorov and the ones from the IPOL authors. The latter can be identified by "//[IPOl]". Please read the IPOL article and its references for any explanations about the algorithm and its implementation.

You can also try this algorithm online. Stereo-rectified pairs are available on the IPOL demo page.
